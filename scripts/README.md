# Repository Scripts

This directory will contain repeatable repository automation that is not owned by a specific application.

Candidate responsibilities include:

- local environment setup;
- formatting and validation entry points;
- contract generation and compatibility checks;
- documentation validation;
- test orchestration;
- database and fixture utilities;
- release and deployment support.

## Rules

- Scripts must be documented, idempotent where practical, and safe by default.
- Destructive operations must require explicit confirmation or an explicit noninteractive flag.
- Scripts must return meaningful exit codes and avoid hiding failures.
- Secrets must be provided through approved environment or secret-management mechanisms.
- CI and local development should call the same underlying commands when practical.
- Platform-specific scripts must have a documented reason and supported environment.

## Backend validation scripts

- `backend/export-openapi.sh` exports the running API contract to the checked-in OpenAPI snapshot.
- `backend/check-dotnet-vulnerabilities.sh` writes the .NET direct/transitive vulnerability result
  as JSON and fails when any advisory is reported. CI retains this evidence for the candidate SHA.
- `backend/generate-migration-script.sh` restores the repository tool manifest and creates a
  nonempty idempotent PostgreSQL migration artifact from the complete EF Core migration chain.
- `backend/check-openapi.sh` verifies that a running API has not drifted from that snapshot.
- `backend/smoke-keycloak.mjs` drives the real Authorization Code plus PKCE flow in two isolated Chromium profiles. It verifies the backend-managed cookie session, absence of provider tokens from `/api/v1/session`, CSRF-protected lot creation, and a `404` cross-user ownership boundary. Start the local Compose services, apply migrations, and start the HTTPS API before running it. The two development-fixture passwords are supplied only through `KITCHENFLOW_SMOKE_PASSWORD_A` and `KITCHENFLOW_SMOKE_PASSWORD_B`; never put them in a command history, source file, CI log, or committed environment file.

The Keycloak smoke expects a browser that trusts the local HTTPS certificate. On Linux it selects
the operating-system trust store so an explicitly installed development CA is honored; this does
not bypass validation. `KITCHENFLOW_SMOKE_ALLOW_UNTRUSTED_LOCAL_CERTIFICATE=1` is available only to
diagnose a local trust bootstrap problem and is not accepted validation evidence or a CI setting.

The OpenAPI scripts likewise require a trusted local certificate by default.
`KITCHENFLOW_OPENAPI_ALLOW_UNTRUSTED_LOCAL_CERTIFICATE=1` is a diagnostic-only local escape hatch;
CI uses its loopback HTTP endpoint and accepted local evidence does not use this setting.

See the [`backend inventory runbook`](../docs/operations/backend-inventory-runbook.md) for exact
commands, deployment evidence, forward-repair policy, and troubleshooting.
