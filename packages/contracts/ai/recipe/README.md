Strict machine contracts for `recipe.suggest_candidates.v1` and `recipe.expand_selected.v1`.

Governing research plan: [`../../../docs/plans/PLAN-0022-evaluate-and-finalize-recipe-ai-contracts.md`](../../../docs/plans/PLAN-0022-evaluate-and-finalize-recipe-ai-contracts.md)

## Contents

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `schemas/` | Closed JSON Schema 2020-12 response contracts |
| `fixtures/responses/positive/` | Schema+semantic pass fixtures |
| `fixtures/responses/negative/` | Expected schema or semantic failures |

## Commands

```bash
cd packages/contracts/ai/recipe
npm install
npm test

```

Live provider evaluation is separate and must not run in default CI:

```bash
# from repository root, with DEEPSEEK_API_KEY set in the environment
node scripts/ai/recipe-live-eval.mjs
```

## Bounds (protocol 0.3)

- exactly three candidates per suggestion response;
- summary ≤ 18 words;
- ≤ 10 inventory uses and ≤ 5 additional ingredients per candidate;
- canonical units: `g`, `ml`, `unit`;
- expansion ≤ 14 stages and ≤ 8 preparations;
- `thumbnailVisual.schemaVersion = "1"` with bounded visible components and no private context, cache hashes, or provider policy.
