/**
 * Exact wire-literal unions for closed-set ("controlled") profile fields.
 *
 * Unlike `src/features/profile/catalog` (a frontend-owned, non-exhaustive
 * convenience catalog for free-form stable codes), every value here is a hard
 * backend enum member or a hard-coded closed value object — see
 * `apps/backend/src/KitchenFlow.Modules.Profiles/Domain/ProfileValues.cs`. The
 * backend rejects any other value with `validation_failed`, so these unions must
 * be kept in exact sync with that file, casing included:
 *
 * - `language`: `LanguageTag.TryCreate` (`en` | `pt-BR` | `es`).
 * - `region`: `RegionCode.TryCreate` (`US` | `BR` | `ES`).
 * - `currency`: `CurrencyCode.TryCreate` (`USD` | `BRL` | `EUR`).
 * - Everything else: a C# enum parsed case-insensitively via
 *   `ProfileEnumParser`, so the PascalCase member name is the canonical wire
 *   value this frontend always sends.
 *
 * `displayName` and `timeZone` are intentionally absent: both are open-ended
 * validated strings (`DisplayName`, `IanaTimeZoneId`), not closed enumerations,
 * and stay free-text controls.
 *
 * This module is imported both by the live adapter (`src/adapters/live/profile`,
 * to fail closed on an unrecognized wire value) and by the presentation layer
 * (`src/features/profile`, to render a closed `select`/`radio` control instead of
 * free text), so it lives in `src/contracts/profile` rather than either side.
