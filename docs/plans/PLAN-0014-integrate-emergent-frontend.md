- **Branch:** `agent/plan-0014-integrate-emergent-frontend`
- **Pull request:** [Draft PR #14](https://github.com/RodrigoWantuk/WTK.KitchenFlow/pull/14)
- **Related implementation plans:** PLAN-0004 (superseded), PLAN-0005, PLAN-0011
- **Related documentation plan:** PLAN-0013
- **Related issues:** None
- **Related ADRs:** ADR-0001 (superseded by ADR-0007), ADR-0007
- **Dependencies:** Emergent snapshot `69f798f66b7987c4ed785c52c90a5539bf46f52e` available locally

## Objective

Import the final Emergent frontend snapshot into `apps/frontend` as the sole official KitchenFlow frontend source, complete three partially implemented product flows (shared preparation-route state, reserved prepared-component presentation, route-to-cooking handoff), add reservation-aware shopping projections, remove Emergent platform coupling, establish TypeScript and adapter boundaries for gradual backend integration, **migrate all application source under `apps/frontend/src` from JavaScript to TypeScript**, activate frontend quality gates and CI, and open a draft PR against `main`.


## Context

PLAN-0004 assumed Lovable generation into a dedicated repository followed by monorepo integration. The authoritative product prototype was instead completed in `RodrigoWantuk/kitchen-emergent` and must be imported once. After this plan:

- `WTK.KitchenFlow/apps/frontend` is the only official frontend source;
- `kitchen-emergent` is a historical snapshot that may be archived;
- no bidirectional sync with Emergent is planned;
- Lovable and Emergent remain optional generation tools only.

Authoritative inventory arithmetic, reservations, unit conversion, and food-safety rules remain backend responsibilities. The frontend may only render projections and hold temporary UI state.

## Scope

### Included

- Faithful import of `frontend/` from Emergent commit `69f798f66b7987c4ed785c52c90a5539bf46f52e`.
- Shared preparation-route application state used by Home, Plan, full route, and cook handoff.
- Reserved prepared-component presentation model and UI.
- Route-complete → Cook CTA hierarchy and handoff payload.
- Reservation-aware shopping requirement projections (fixture-backed).
- Removal of Emergent platform coupling.
- Mock/live adapter isolation and TypeScript boundaries for models, adapters, and projections.
- **Full migration of `apps/frontend/src` application sources from `.js`/`.jsx` to `.ts`/`.tsx` (Phase 8), including typed domain fixtures, store, pages, shell, and UI primitives.**
- Frontend CI: install, lockfile, build, lint, format, typecheck, unit/component/route tests, dependency audit, scenario-resource production guard.
- Asset license audit for public repository exposure.
- Supersession of PLAN-0004; reconciliation of PLAN-0005 and PLAN-0011; ADR-0007.
- Draft PR against `main` (no merge).

### Excluded

- Backend behavior changes.
- FastAPI/MongoDB import.
- Authoritative inventory, reservation, allocation, or unit-conversion logic in React.
- Food-safety enforcement.
- Direct AI provider calls.
- Token storage or direct Keycloak client.
- General visual redesign.
- Profile live adapters against unmerged backend PRs.
- PLAN-0005 independent test execution as this plan's author.
- Rewriting CRA/CRACO to Vite/Next (runtime stays per ADR-0007).
- Replacing Unsplash/mock remote imagery (tracked in asset audit; separate follow-up unless required for CI).
- Hand-authored OpenAPI DTO duplicates (live clients remain generated later).

## Requirements and constraints

- Import only Emergent `frontend/`; exclude `backend/`, `.emergent/`, `memory/`, `test_reports/`, `.env`, MongoDB, FastAPI, installed dependencies, and logs.
- Final layout must be `apps/frontend/{package.json,src,public}` without nested `apps/frontend/frontend/`.
- First import commit must be faithful and not mixed with large refactors.
- React and TypeScript are architectural decisions; Emergent and Lovable are optional tooling.
- Do not duplicate OpenAPI DTOs by hand.
- Do not integrate profile contracts from unapproved PRs.
- Preserve accepted mock prototype flows while isolating them from production paths.
- Update PLAN-0014 and `docs/plan-status.md` in every agent commit.

## Substantial run delivery target

- **Target outcome:** Complete PLAN-0014 through draft PR #14: prior phases 0–7 **plus Phase 8 full TypeScript migration** of `apps/frontend/src`, with green typecheck/lint/test/build and no remaining application `.js`/`.jsx` under `src/`.
- **Minimum acceptable evidence:** zero application JS/JSX under `src/`; `yarn typecheck` strict; ESLint covers TS/TSX; tests and build green; plan/registry truthful; draft PR updated (no merge by agent).
- **Adjacent checkpoints to continue through when unblocked:** Phase 8a → 8f below in order.
- **Valid early-stop conditions:** environment/tool failure, conflicting concurrent work, exhausted capacity, or required stakeholder decision.

## Documentation deliverables

### Durable documentation

- PLAN-0014 execution plan and registry updates.
- PLAN-0004 superseded; PLAN-0005 dependency on PLAN-0014 baseline; PLAN-0011 remains blocked until baseline merges.
- ADR-0007 superseding ADR-0001.
- Frontend README: official source, provenance, development, mock/live, CI.
- Import provenance record (repository, branch, commit, date, method, included/excluded paths).
- Asset audit notes.

### Code-level documentation

- TSDoc for exported TypeScript contracts, adapters, and shared hooks.
- Inline comments only for non-obvious invariants (shared route state, projection boundaries, cook handoff hierarchy).

## Assumptions and open questions

### Assumptions

- Local Emergent clone can be checked out to the pinned commit.
- CRA + CRACO runtime from the snapshot remains acceptable under ADR-0007 until a later ADR changes it.
- Yarn classic matches the Emergent `packageManager` field.
- Full JS→TS migration can proceed on the open draft PR #14 branch without changing product behavior.
- shadcn/Radix UI primitives can be converted file-by-file with props typed from `@radix-ui/*` and local wrappers; visual output must remain unchanged.

### Open questions

- None blocking Phase 8. Exact live OpenAPI client generation remains a later plan after inventory/home contracts stabilize.

## Architecture and contract impact

- `apps/frontend` becomes the official frontend package.
- Presentation components consume application models and projections, never authoritative arithmetic.
- Mock adapters produce fixtures; live adapters will later consume generated OpenAPI clients.
- ADR-0007 records React/TypeScript, monorepo authority, and optional generation tooling.

## Execution phases

### Phase 0: Governance

- [x] Create PLAN-0014 and register it.
- [x] Mark PLAN-0004 Superseded by PLAN-0014.
- [x] Update PLAN-0005 to depend on PLAN-0014 baseline.
- [x] Keep PLAN-0011 blocked pending baseline integration.
- [x] Add ADR-0007 and supersede ADR-0001.

### Phase 1: Faithful import

- [x] Copy Emergent `frontend/` into `apps/frontend/`.
- [x] Record provenance.
- [x] Commit without feature refactors.

### Phase 2: Shared preparation route state

- [x] Single store/adapter boundary for route task completion.
- [x] Home carousel and full route share state; unlock next dependency; start-now has consequence.

### Phase 3: Reserved component presentation

- [x] `PreparedComponentAvailability` projection; presentational bar; review-shortfall action.

### Phase 4: Route-to-cooking handoff

- [x] Ready state, correct recipe id, CTA hierarchy, “Later” preserves completion, cook payload.

### Phase 5: Reservation-aware shopping

- [x] `ShoppingRequirementProjection` fixtures and UI; send only shortfall.

### Phase 6: Stabilization

- [x] Remove Emergent coupling; isolate mock/live; TypeScript boundaries; session/API seams.

### Phase 7: Quality gates and handoff

- [x] Mandatory tests; CI workflow; asset audit; finalize docs; open draft PR.

### Phase 8: Full TypeScript migration of `apps/frontend/src`

Stakeholder decision (2026-07-31): complete ADR-0007’s React/TypeScript platform decision **inside PLAN-0014** rather than deferring. Behavior and UX must remain unchanged; this is a language/typing migration only.

**Inventory at plan expansion (approx.):** ~73 `.js`/`.jsx` remaining under `src/`; ~17 already `.ts`/`.tsx` (contracts, adapters, features, tests).

#### Phase 8a — Tooling and gates

- [x] Add TypeScript ESLint parsing (`typescript-eslint`) so `yarn lint` covers `.ts`/`.tsx`.
- [x] Keep `strict: true`; temporarily keep `allowJs: true` until 8f.
- [x] Add CI/local guard script (or test) that fails if any `src/**/*.{js,jsx}` remain after 8f.
- [x] Document migration rules in `apps/frontend/README.md` (rename + types, no behavior change, TSDoc for new exports).

#### Phase 8b — Shared libraries and domain fixtures

Convert and type, in dependency order:

- [x] `lib/utils.js` → `.ts`
- [x] `lib/i18n.js` → `.ts` (typed message keys as `string` paths initially; avoid breaking tr() call sites)
- [x] `lib/mockData.js` → `.ts` with exported interfaces for pantry items, recipes, plan entries, shopping items, scenarios
- [x] `lib/store.js` → `.ts` / `.tsx` as needed; typed context value; remove ambient `react-app-env.d.ts` store shim when obsolete
- [x] `hooks/use-toast.js` → `.ts`
- [x] `constants/testIds/**` → `.ts`

#### Phase 8c — UI primitives (`components/ui/*`)

- [x] Convert all shadcn/Radix wrappers (~46 files) `.jsx` → `.tsx` with explicit prop types (or `ComponentPropsWithoutRef` from underlying primitives).
- [x] Replace temporary `react-app-env.d.ts` module shims for `@/components/ui/*` as real components become typed.
- [x] After each batch: `yarn typecheck` green.

#### Phase 8d — App shell and feature components

- [x] `components/AppShell.jsx`, `ScenarioBar.jsx` → `.tsx`
- [x] `components/plan/PlanDialogs.jsx`, `PlanExtras.jsx` → `.tsx` (re-exports already used by TS features)

#### Phase 8e — Pages and entrypoints

- [x] All `pages/*.jsx` → `.tsx` (Landing, Access, Onboarding, Today, Pantry, ItemForm, ItemDetail, Recipes, RecipeDetail, CookFlow, Plan, Shopping, Settings)
- [x] `App.js` → `App.tsx`, `index.js` → `index.tsx`
- [x] Fix imports/extensions and CRA entry resolution as required

#### Phase 8f — Enforce TypeScript-only application sources

- [x] Delete remaining application `.js`/`.jsx` under `src/` (none left except if CRA requires a non-src config file outside `src/`).
- [x] Set `allowJs: false` in `tsconfig.json`.
- [x] Ensure `yarn lint` includes TS/TSX; `yarn typecheck`, `yarn test`, `yarn build` green.
- [x] CI isolation/guard confirms zero `src/**/*.{js,jsx}`.
- [x] Update frontend README + PLAN-0014 acceptance; keep draft PR #14 (no merge by agent).

**Migration rules (mandatory):**

1. Prefer rename + annotate over rewrite; do not change UX copy, routes, testids, or mock scenarios unless required for typing.
2. Presentation components still must not gain authoritative inventory/reservation arithmetic.
3. Do not hand-duplicate OpenAPI DTOs; keep presentation contracts in `src/contracts/`.
4. Commit in cohesive batches (8b, 8c, 8d, 8e, 8f) with plan/registry updates each time.
5. Generated or vendor-like UI may use narrow `eslint-disable` / typed `any` only with a one-line why comment; prefer eliminating before Phase 8f.

## Testing and validation plan

- Unit/component tests for route carousel, reserved bar, cook handoff, shopping projections.
- Build, lint (JS/TS), format, typecheck (`strict`, eventually `allowJs: false`).
- Guard: no application `src/**/*.{js,jsx}` after Phase 8f.
- Mock/production isolation guard.
- Dependency audit.
- Responsive/a11y smoke checklist (360/768/1280, 200% zoom, keyboard, touch, reduced motion, pt-BR/en/es).
- After each Phase 8 batch: `yarn typecheck && yarn test && yarn build` (or equivalent CRACO commands).

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Snapshot `69f798f66b7987c4ed785c52c90a5539bf46f52e` imported.
- [x] `apps/frontend` is the official source.
- [x] PLAN-0004 Superseded; ADR updated; PLAN-0005 and PLAN-0011 reconciled.
- [x] Home and full route share preparation state.
- [x] Next actionable task highlighted; blocked tasks not highlighted.
- [x] Completing last required dependency offers Cook.
- [x] Reserved/free/shortfall bar complete from projections.
- [x] Shopping review represents availability and reservations; only shortfall is sent.
- [x] No authoritative reservation/inventory arithmetic in presentation components.
- [x] Mock and production isolated; Emergent deps removed.
- [x] Build, lint, typecheck, and tests green (pre–Phase 8 baseline).
- [x] Assets audited; CI active; docs complete.
- [x] Draft PR open against `main`; no unrelated changes; no merge.
- [x] All application sources under `apps/frontend/src` are TypeScript (`.ts`/`.tsx`); no remaining `.js`/`.jsx` there.
- [x] `tsconfig` uses `strict: true` and `allowJs: false` after migration.
- [x] ESLint typechecks/lints `.ts`/`.tsx`; CI enforces the no-JS-under-src guard.
- [x] Post-migration `yarn typecheck`, `yarn lint`, `yarn test`, and `yarn build` are green without behavior regressions to mock flows.

## Execution state

- **Current checkpoint:** Phase 8 complete — `apps/frontend/src` is TypeScript-only (`allowJs: false`); draft PR #14 updated, not merged.
- **Last completed step:** Phase 8a–8f migration validated locally (guard, typecheck, lint 0 errors, 10 tests, build).
- **Exact next action:** Owner review of draft PR #14 after CI green; merge only with owner approval.
- **Blockers:** None.
- **Partially modified areas:** Some mock/page props still use narrow `any` for heterogeneous fixtures; refine in later cleanup if desired.
- **Validation performed:** `yarn guard:ts-only`; `yarn typecheck`; `yarn lint` (0 errors); `yarn test` (10); `yarn build`; 0 `.js`/`.jsx` under `src/` (~90 `.ts`/`.tsx`).
- **Known failures or limitations:** Live OpenAPI adapters still placeholders; mock Unsplash imagery still prototype-only per asset audit.
- **Working tree state:** Phase 8 code + plan/registry updates ready to commit/push to PR #14.
- **Substantial run target:** Achieved for Phase 8; PLAN-0014 awaiting owner merge.
