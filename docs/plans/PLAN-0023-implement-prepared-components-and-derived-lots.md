# PLAN-0023: Implement Prepared Components and Derived Inventory Lots

- **Status:** In Progress
- **Type:** Implementation
- **Priority:** High
- **Owner:** Codex backend/domain implementation agent
- **Created:** 2026-08-02
- **Last updated:** 2026-08-05T13:57:56Z
- **Branch:** `agent/plan-0023-prepared-component-lots`
- **Pull request:** Draft [PR #39](https://github.com/RodrigoWantuk/WTK.Cocinaris/pull/39)
- **Dependencies:** PLAN-0003 and PLAN-0016 inventory foundations merged
- **Related product:** `docs/product/closed-loop-kitchen-orchestration.md`
- **Related domain:** `docs/domain/inventory-lifecycle.md`
- **Successor:** Sequential planning receives a separate plan after this contract is stable

## Objective

Implement the first bounded backend slice from the accepted closed-loop orchestration order: prepared reusable components and derived inventory lots with provenance, quantity/state, parent consumption, storage, shelf-life evidence, reservations, history, concurrency, and idempotent authoritative transactions.

## User outcome

KitchenFlow can represent outputs such as stock, cooked beans, sauce, dough, chopped vegetables, shredded meat, or meal bases as real inventory lots rather than recipe notes, preserving where they came from and how they may be reused.

## Included scope

- prepared-component product/lot identity;
- partial lot transitions and derived-lot provenance;
- parent input lot references and actual consumed quantities;
- produced quantity/yield and canonical unit or qualitative availability;
- prepared timestamp, storage, lifecycle state, shelf-life evidence, and confidence;
- atomic consume-input/create-output transaction;
- immutable history and audit-safe projections;
- owner isolation;
- ETag/`If-Match`, idempotency, and retry-safe behavior;
- reservation/allocation compatibility;
- PostgreSQL migration and forward-repair guidance;
- OpenAPI 3.1 contracts and generated TypeScript client;
- backend/domain/application/integration/contract tests;
- minimal production frontend projection only if required to inspect the new lots; broad cooking UI is excluded;
- operations/runbook and code-level documentation.

## Excluded scope

- sequential weekly planning simulation;
- recipe generation or AI calls;
- complete guided cooking execution;
- final execution reconciliation;
- localized plan recovery;
- preparation reminders/scheduler;
- multi-day route UI;
- troubleshooting;
- package optimization;
- multi-user household collaboration.

## Domain invariants

- A prepared component is an authoritative inventory lot.
- Creation cannot occur without an explicit source transaction or authorized manual correction path.
- Input consumption and output creation commit atomically.
- A partial input transition preserves the unaffected remainder as its own lot state when required.
- Provenance links are immutable history, not cross-module mutable references.
- Quantity arithmetic, units, ownership, shelf-life source, and reservations remain deterministic.
- Duplicate command delivery cannot consume inputs or create outputs twice.
- A user cannot reference or infer another user's parent lots.
- AI never creates the transaction directly.

## Delivery phases

### Phase 1 — Domain and application contract

- define prepared-component identity and provenance;
- define command/query ports;
- define transaction, correction, and error semantics;
- define compatibility with current inventory lots/history.

### Phase 2 — Persistence and migration

- schema/migration/indexes/constraints;
- atomic parent consumption and output creation;
- concurrency and idempotency;
- migration from current `main`, idempotent script, and fail-closed invalid-data behavior.

### Phase 3 — HTTP and generated contracts

- endpoints/commands for creating and inspecting prepared outputs;
- ETag, CSRF, Problem Details, idempotency headers;
- OpenAPI export/lint/drift;
- generated client regeneration.

### Phase 4 — Tests and operations

- domain and application tests;
- PostgreSQL integration and concurrency tests;
- cross-user isolation;
- retry/replay;
- migration and forward repair;
- telemetry redaction;
- runbook and evidence.

## Independent validation

Because the plan affects inventory consumption, derived lots, concurrency, and migrations, create a separate independent testing plan before completion or as the implementation reaches `Validating`.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Prepared outputs are first-class owner-scoped lots.
- [x] Inputs and outputs reconcile atomically.
- [x] Partial transitions preserve correct remainder and provenance.
- [x] Duplicate requests cannot double-consume or duplicate outputs.
- [x] Cross-user parent references return nondisclosing failure.
- [x] ETag, CSRF, idempotency, and Problem Details are complete.
- [x] Migration and forward-repair paths are tested.
- [x] OpenAPI/generated client are reproducible.
- [x] Telemetry and history contain no private payload leakage.
- [ ] Independent test plan provides a final assessment.
- [x] Sequential planning is not implemented prematurely.

## Corrective acceptance criteria

- [x] Declared yield is persisted as immutable measured or qualitative batch history.
- [x] Batch and provenance reads do not reconstruct declared yield from output-lot state.
- [x] Idempotent replay and subsequent reads retain the same historical declared yield after output consumption.
- [x] Concurrent same-key adjustment delivery replays the winner; different keys retain stale-precondition behavior.
- [x] Null, missing, empty, and invalid preparation collections return validation failures rather than server errors.
- [x] Provenance is bounded and set-loaded without unbounded N+1 batch reads.
- [x] Replacement candidate exact-head Backend, Frontend, PLAN-0005, evidence-consistency, quality, and secret-scan gates passed.
- [ ] Independent PLAN-0026 validation provides its final assessment.

## Execution state

- **Claimed at:** 2026-08-04T01:24:28Z
- **Main baseline:** `f166ce21020f6704d3fcd99b4b6d195b33638155`
- **Current checkpoint:** PLAN-0026 independently assessed immutable candidate `7e24fa2f86350d8a566de0b9f2f1cdba984080ff` as **Fail** in Draft PR #40. That candidate, the prior `b72e8efaa6ae6c97998a92967b8e6112f326a14c`, and `c861cb6cfc13c37874e91d825c5dc8e6f2238db7` are superseded; PR #39 remains Draft during remediation.
- **Run target:** Deliver the complete owner-scoped preparation transaction vertical slice: domain/application contract, atomic PostgreSQL persistence and migration, HTTP/OpenAPI/client contract, tests, operations documentation, implementation evidence, and an independently testable candidate.
- **Blockers:** Replacement exact-head CI and a subsequent independent retest are required. Existing untracked frontend build and smoke artifacts are preserved and excluded from this plan.
- **Exact next action:** Complete F-0026-01/02/03 remediation, publish a new exact green candidate, then pin a separate PLAN-0027 independent retest without reopening PLAN-0026.

## Progress log

### 2026-08-04T01:24:28Z — Codex backend/domain implementation agent

- **Run delivery target:** Complete the prepared-component and derived-lot backend vertical slice through an independently testable candidate.
- **Checkpoint:** Claimed PLAN-0023 from the verified `origin/main` baseline `f166ce21020f6704d3fcd99b4b6d195b33638155`.
- **Changes included in the commit:** Plan claim, registry reconciliation, and Draft PLAN-0026 independent-validation placeholder only.
- **Documentation reviewed:** Repository rules, plan registry, active-plan contract, inventory module/application/persistence/API orientation, product lifecycle, domain inventory lifecycle, security, testing gates, and migration/runbook conventions.
- **Evidence and validation:** `hostname` confirmed `NOTEBOOK-DEB-RODRIGO`; `github-app-run git fetch --all --prune`; `github-app-run git pull --ff-only origin main`; baseline confirmed as `f166ce21020f6704d3fcd99b4b6d195b33638155`.
- **Defects or coverage gaps:** No product validation executed yet. Pre-existing untracked generated build/smoke artifacts remain outside the commit.
- **Result:** Claim complete; implementation may begin.
- **Next action:** Deliver Phase 1 domain/application contracts and begin Phase 2 persistence.

### 2026-08-04T01:43:45Z — Codex backend/domain implementation agent

- **Run delivery target:** Deliver the first complete implementation checkpoint: deterministic preparation transaction behavior from domain through generated contract.
- **Checkpoint:** Implemented manual preparation batches with multi-parent measured consumption, a single output product partitioned into portions, immutable provenance/history, owner-scoped queries, per-parent opaque concurrency versions, semantic idempotency, and prepared shelf-life metadata.
- **Changes included in the commit:** Inventory domain/application/persistence/API contracts; relational migration and append-only triggers; OpenAPI snapshot and generated TypeScript mirrors; unit and migration-constraint tests; lifecycle and runbook documentation; implementation evidence scaffold.
- **Documentation reviewed:** Product closed-loop orchestration, inventory lifecycle, architecture principles, privacy, testing gates, backend workflow, current inventory implementation, and migration conventions.
- **Evidence and validation:** Build and unit tests passed (`49` unit tests). Empty local PostgreSQL database upgraded through `20260804013603_AddPreparedComponentTransactions`; preparation triggers were verified. OpenAPI export/check/lint and all generated-client checks passed. Integration-suite execution was attempted twice; the environment emitted pre-existing OIDC redirect `500` failures before a conclusive full-suite summary, so it is not treated as passing evidence.
- **Defects or coverage gaps:** Dedicated preparation PostgreSQL atomicity/race tests and full exact-head CI remain required. Reservation/lock persistence is intentionally not implemented because planning data does not yet exist; the compatibility boundary is documented.
- **Result:** Implementation checkpoint complete and compiling; not yet ready for independent validation.
- **Next action:** Add preparation-specific integration tests, execute migration/idempotent-script and full CI gates, then update evidence and publish an immutable candidate.

### 2026-08-04T01:49:00Z — Codex backend/domain implementation agent

- **Run delivery target:** Extend the implementation checkpoint with real PostgreSQL provenance integrity coverage.
- **Checkpoint:** Added a Testcontainers PostgreSQL test that creates an authoritative preparation graph, verifies append-only batch/input/output metadata, and proves composite owner links reject a mismatched owner.
- **Changes included in the commit:** Preparation provenance integration test and synchronized evidence/plan state.
- **Evidence and validation:** `PreparationProvenanceIsOwnerConsistentAndAppendOnly` passed against PostgreSQL 18 (1/1).
- **Defects or coverage gaps:** Atomic write-store rollback and concurrent stale-parent delivery require dedicated tests; full exact-head CI is still pending.
- **Result:** PostgreSQL integrity checkpoint passed.
- **Next action:** Add write-store atomic rollback/concurrency tests and complete required gates.

### 2026-08-04T21:53:04Z — Codex backend/domain implementation agent

- **Run delivery target:** Close the preparation transaction correctness gap before executing the full candidate gate matrix.
- **Checkpoint:** Preparation validation is now side-effect free until every input and output rule passes. PostgreSQL integration coverage proves full rollback when output persistence fails, one-winner behavior for concurrent different keys, and authoritative replay for concurrent same-key delivery.
- **Changes included in the commit:** Deterministic semantic output hashing; deferred detached parent mutation; concurrent idempotency reread; one unit test and three real PostgreSQL Testcontainers tests.
- **Evidence and validation:** `dotnet build KitchenFlow.slnx -c Release --no-restore` passed; UnitTests passed 50/50; `PostgreSqlInventoryPreparationStoreTests` passed 3/3 against PostgreSQL 18.
- **Defects or coverage gaps:** The broader Backend workflow, idempotent migration-script execution, HTTP/Keycloak checks, OpenAPI/client drift, secret scan, and exact-head CI remain unverified.
- **Result:** Atomic write-store and concurrency checkpoint passed locally; the plan remains In Progress.
- **Next action:** Run the complete local validation matrix and write privacy-safe exact-command evidence.

### 2026-08-04T22:12:24Z — Codex backend/domain implementation agent

- **Run delivery target:** Execute the complete candidate validation matrix and leave a truthful resumable validation handoff.
- **Checkpoint:** Consolidated preparation PostgreSQL tests into the existing migration fixture and serialized integration test collections to avoid concurrent ephemeral PostgreSQL pressure. Focused validation passed: 50 unit tests, 14 architecture tests, 3 preparation PostgreSQL tests, 29 telemetry-redaction tests, and one Keycloak-backed authenticated-session test. Migration upgrade, idempotent script application twice (9/9 migrations), OpenAPI/client gates, dependency scan, and frontend matrix passed.
- **Changes included in the commit:** Integration fixture serialization; focused verification results; complete privacy-safe command evidence and handoff.
- **Evidence and validation:** `docs/evidence/plan-0023/command-results.json` records commands, working directories, timestamps, exit outcomes, artifacts, and tested revisions. The frontend gate emitted existing React dialog/act warnings without failing.
- **Defects or coverage gaps:** The full integration assembly remains inconclusive: local Docker repeatedly paused or recycled Testcontainers PostgreSQL instances even after test collections were serialized. Local gitleaks is unavailable; CI owns that gate. Exact-head CI has not yet run.
- **Result:** Do not move PLAN-0023 to `Validating`; PLAN-0026 remains Draft and unpinned.
- **Next action:** Re-run `.github/workflows/backend.yml`'s complete test step on a clean Docker host or exact-head CI, record the outcome, then evaluate candidate publication.

### 2026-08-04T22:20:36Z — Codex backend/domain implementation agent

- **Run delivery target:** Add transport-level proof for the production preparation endpoint while exact-head CI executes the complete Backend workflow.
- **Checkpoint:** Added an authenticated HTTP integration test that creates a preparation with CSRF and a resource-bound parent ETag, replays the same idempotency key, then verifies the authoritative parent remainder and owned batch/provenance projections.
- **Changes included in the commit:** API preparation transaction test plus synchronized evidence and plan state.
- **Evidence and validation:** Targeted HTTP test passed 1/1; `dotnet build KitchenFlow.slnx -c Release --no-restore` passed. Exact-head CI has passed secret scan, two frontend quality/browser-smoke workflows, and PLAN-0025 p0/p1 validation jobs; Backend `build-and-test` remains in progress.
- **Defects or coverage gaps:** The new exact-head Backend workflow must still pass before the local full-integration limitation can be considered resolved. Local gitleaks remains unavailable.
- **Result:** PLAN-0023 remains In Progress and PLAN-0026 remains Draft/unpinned.
- **Next action:** Push this test checkpoint, inspect exact-head Backend CI, and only then decide whether a candidate can move to `Validating`.

### 2026-08-04T22:30:00Z — Codex backend/domain implementation agent

- **Run delivery target:** Publish the exact green implementation candidate for independent validation without claiming the independent assessment.
- **Checkpoint:** Exact-head CI passed for immutable candidate `b72e8efaa6ae6c97998a92967b8e6112f326a14c`. PLAN-0023 moved to `Validating`; PLAN-0026 is `Ready` and pinned to that candidate.
- **Evidence and validation:** Backend `build-and-test` and secret scan passed in run `30956077382`; frontend quality/browser-smoke passed in runs `30956074507` and `30956077386`; evidence consistency plus p0/p1 validation passed in run `30956077424`. The draft implementation PR remains [PR #39](https://github.com/RodrigoWantuk/WTK.Cocinaris/pull/39).
- **Defects or coverage gaps:** No independent test execution or assessment has been performed. The previous local Docker/Testcontainers full-suite limitation remains historical evidence only; it is resolved for this candidate by the exact-head Backend workflow.
- **Result:** Ready for independent validation; not completed and not merge-authorized.
- **Next action:** An independent testing agent claims and executes PLAN-0026 from an isolated test branch and detached candidate worktree.

### 2026-08-04T23:00:00Z — Codex backend/domain implementation agent

- **Checkpoint:** Reopened corrective implementation after PLAN-0005 run `30956720196` found `ConcurrentAdjustmentWithSameKeyReplaysTheWinningResponse` returning 412 for one same-key delivery. Review also found that batch reads reconstructed declared yield from mutable output lots.
- **Result:** The prior `b72e8efaa6ae6c97998a92967b8e6112f326a14c` candidate and `c861cb6cfc13c37874e91d825c5dc8e6f2238db7` head are not validation candidates. PLAN-0023 is `In Progress`; PLAN-0026 is returned to Draft and unpinned.
- **Next action:** Implement, test, and publish the replacement candidate; do not execute independent PLAN-0026 work.

### 2026-08-05T00:05:00Z — Codex backend/domain implementation agent

- **Checkpoint:** Persisted the immutable declared-yield quantity mode on preparation batches, made batch and provenance views read it rather than mutable output quantities, bounded provenance to fifty deterministic related batches per direction with set-based graph loading, and added HTTP null-collection/item validation.
- **Concurrency correction:** Same-key adjustment replay now checks the owner-scoped idempotency record before stale `If-Match` evaluation after ownership is established. This closes the observed race where the winner advanced the token before the second delivery performed its precondition check.
- **Evidence and validation:** Release build and `migrations has-pending-model-changes` passed with explicit Release configuration. Focused real-PostgreSQL and HTTP tests passed 7/7, including same-key adjustment, immutable yield after output consumption, provenance, and null input/output collection cases.
- **Next action:** Add remaining adversarial coverage, execute migration/API/client gates and repeated concurrency runs, then record outcomes and publish a replacement candidate.

### 2026-08-05T00:45:34Z — Codex backend/domain implementation agent

- **Checkpoint:** Generated the revised idempotent migration script, confirmed the Release model has no pending changes, exported/linted/checked OpenAPI, regenerated and drift-checked both generated clients, and passed frontend typecheck/lint/format checks.
- **Evidence and validation:** The focused correction suite passed 7/7. Broader local integration commands were started but their complete summaries remain inconclusive in the known local Testcontainers environment; this is not counted as a pass. Exact-head workflows for corrective head `f0cc72d` have started, with secret scan already passing.
- **Result:** PLAN-0023 remains In Progress and PLAN-0026 remains Draft/unpinned until a replacement exact-head candidate is green.
- **Next action:** Inspect all `f0cc72d` workflow results, remediate any failure, then pin only the final green exact head.

### 2026-08-05T01:01:47Z — Codex backend/domain implementation agent

- **Checkpoint:** Published replacement candidate `7e24fa2f86350d8a566de0b9f2f1cdba984080ff` after every exact-head required workflow passed.
- **Root cause and correction:** The prior adjustment race evaluated `If-Match` before a replay lookup, so a second same-key delivery that loaded the winner's new token returned 412. It now performs owner-scoped idempotency lookup before precondition evaluation. Declared yield is now persisted in `inventory.preparation_batches`; no read derives it from mutable output lots.
- **Evidence and validation:** Backend/secret scan run `30964375294` passed; frontend quality/browser-smoke runs `30964372594` and `30964375347` passed; PLAN-0005 p0, p1, and evidence consistency run `30964375297` passed. The same-key HTTP test passed 21 consecutive local executions without a retry wrapper.
- **Result:** PLAN-0023 is `Validating`; PLAN-0026 is Ready and pinned. No independent validation has been executed.
- **Next action:** Independent agent claims PLAN-0026 in an isolated worktree and performs its adversarial validation.

### 2026-08-05T13:57:56Z — Codex backend/domain implementation agent

- **Checkpoint:** Returned PLAN-0023 to In Progress after independent PLAN-0026 Draft PR #40 assessed SUT `7e24fa2f86350d8a566de0b9f2f1cdba984080ff` as Fail. No PLAN-0026 evidence or validation tests were merged into this implementation branch.
- **Findings:** F-0026-01/P1 requires authoritative replay when a same-key preparation loser sees a stale input after the winner commits; F-0026-02/P1 requires a fail-closed declared-yield SQL CHECK; F-0026-03/P2 requires an explicit provenance truncation signal at the existing fifty-batch bound.
- **Remediation target:** Re-read owner-scoped preparation idempotency before stale-precondition failure, make the unmerged batch CHECK definite under SQL NULL semantics, add independent consumed/produced truncation flags, and add permanent product regression coverage.
- **Tracking:** [Issue #41](https://github.com/RodrigoWantuk/WTK.Cocinaris/issues/41) remains open until a future independent PLAN-0027 Pass.
- **Result:** Historical PLAN-0026 Fail evidence remains immutable on PR #40; no approval, auto-merge, merge, or independent retest was performed by the implementation agent.
- **Next action:** Validate the corrective implementation locally, regenerate contracts, and publish only a new exact-head green candidate.

### 2026-08-05T13:57:56Z — Codex backend/domain implementation agent

- **Checkpoint:** Implemented the PLAN-0026 remediation checkpoint. Preparation retries now re-read an owner-scoped idempotency record after parent lookup and before stale-precondition return; the unmerged migration's declared-yield CHECK is explicitly `IS TRUE`; bounded provenance returns independent consumed/produced truncation flags after fetching at most fifty-one identifiers per direction.
- **Changes included in the commit:** Application/persistence/API/OpenAPI/generated-client contracts; revised migration, designer, and snapshot; focused workflow, PostgreSQL direct-SQL matrix and provenance-boundary tests; fifty synchronized HTTP same-key preparation iterations; lifecycle/runbook/evidence updates; immutable PLAN-0026 completion reference; Draft successor PLAN-0027; tracking issue #41.
- **Evidence and validation:** Release build, format verification after formatting, model pending-change validation, focused six unit tests, seven PostgreSQL tests (including invalid/valid yield matrix and 0/1/49/50/51/55 provenance bounds), fifty synchronized HTTP repetitions, and OpenAPI/generated-client gates passed locally. The full local suite and exact-head CI have not yet been rerun for this checkpoint.
- **Defects or coverage gaps:** Existing local complete-integration Docker/Testcontainers instability remains a documented historical limitation. PLAN-0026 evidence was not copied or altered; PLAN-0027 has not been executed.
- **Result:** Corrective implementation checkpoint is ready for full gate execution; PLAN-0023 remains In Progress and no candidate is pinned.
- **Next action:** Commit and push this checkpoint, run all applicable local gates, then wait for exact-head CI before moving PLAN-0023 or PLAN-0027 state.
