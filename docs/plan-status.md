# Plan Execution Registry

This file is the canonical, repository-wide view of implementation, testing, research, documentation, and operational plans.

Detailed plans live under [`docs/plans/`](plans/). This registry exists so that a new agent can understand current work, ownership, progress, blockers, and the exact continuation point without reconstructing state from chat history or branch diffs.

## Mandatory agent rule

Before creating **every commit**, an agent must:

1. update the active plan's `Execution state` and `Progress log` sections;
2. update the matching row in this registry;
3. record the checkpoint represented by the commit, substantial run target, documentation delivered, validation performed, blockers, and exact next action;
4. ensure both files describe the repository state that will exist after the commit.

This requirement applies even when the commit is partial, documentation-only, test-only, or created because the agent must stop. A commit made by an agent without the corresponding plan-state update is noncompliant.

The plan and registry updates should be included in the same commit as the work they describe. Do not create a misleading status-only update before the implementation exists.

## Status model

Use exactly one execution status:

- **Draft**: the plan is being written and is not ready to execute.
- **Ready**: scope and acceptance criteria are sufficiently defined for work to start.
- **In Progress**: implementation or test execution is actively underway.
- **Paused**: work stopped intentionally and can continue without resolving a blocker.
- **Blocked**: work cannot continue until a documented dependency or decision is resolved.
- **Validating**: implementation is complete enough for tests, evaluations, or acceptance verification.
- **Completed**: all plan acceptance criteria and required validation are complete.
- **Cancelled**: work was intentionally abandoned and will not be completed.
- **Superseded**: another plan replaces this plan.

Pull-request and merge state are tracked separately in the `Delivery` column. Execution may be `Completed` while delivery is still `PR open` or `Awaiting owner merge`.

## Active plans

Plans with status `Draft`, `Ready`, `In Progress`, `Paused`, `Blocked`, or `Validating` belong here.

## Registry maintenance rules

- Every plan appears exactly once in this file.
- Link the plan ID to its Markdown file.
- Use ISO 8601 dates and UTC timestamps when time precision matters.
- `Current checkpoint` must state the last verified state, not an intention.
- `Exact next action` must be concrete enough for a different agent to execute immediately.
- `Delivery` must state the repository delivery state.
- A blocked row must identify the blocking dependency or decision.
- When responsibility changes, update the plan and add a handoff entry.
- Move rows between sections instead of duplicating them.
- Preserve historical completed, cancelled, and superseded entries.
- Reconcile delivery state and branch deletion after merge.
